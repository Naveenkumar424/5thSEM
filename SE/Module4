### Architectural Design

**Architectural Design Decisions:**
- Architectural design decisions are crucial choices that define the overall structure and organization of a software system.
- These decisions impact the system's performance, scalability, maintainability, and security.

**Key Factors Influencing Architectural Decisions:**
1. **System Requirements**: Functional and non-functional requirements.
2. **Stakeholder Concerns**: Business goals, user needs, regulatory requirements.
3. **Technological Constraints**: Existing technology stack, integration with legacy systems.
4. **Scalability**: Ability to handle increasing load.
5. **Maintainability**: Ease of making changes or adding new features.
6. **Performance**: System's response time and throughput.
7. **Security**: Protecting data and ensuring privacy.

**Architectural Views:**
- Architectural views are different perspectives or representations of the system's architecture to address various stakeholder concerns.
- **4+1 View Model**: 
  - **Logical View**: Describes the system's functionality.
  - **Development View**: Focuses on the software's structure.
  - **Process View**: Describes the system's dynamic behavior.
  - **Physical View**: Shows the system's deployment.
  - **Scenarios**: Use cases that illustrate the interactions between views.

**Architectural Patterns:**
- Architectural patterns are proven, reusable solutions to common architectural problems.

**1. Layered Architecture:**
- **Description**: Organizes the system into layers with specific responsibilities.
- **Layers**: Presentation, Business Logic, Data Access, Database.
- **Benefits**: Separation of concerns, easy to maintain and test.
- **Example**: Web applications with MVC (Model-View-Controller) structure.

**2. Repository Architecture:**
- **Description**: Centralized repository where all data is stored and managed.
- **Components**: Data repository, data accessors, clients.
- **Benefits**: Easy data sharing and integration.
- **Example**: Version control systems like Git.

**3. Clientâ€“Server Architecture:**
- **Description**: Divides the system into clients that request services and servers that provide them.
- **Components**: Client, Server, Network.
- **Benefits**: Scalability, centralized management, separation of concerns.
- **Example**: Web browsers (clients) interacting with web servers.

### Design and Implementation

**Object-Oriented Design Using UML:**

**1. System Context and Interactions:**
- **System Context Diagram**: Defines the system boundaries and interactions with external entities (actors).
- **Use Case Diagrams**: Illustrate the functional requirements and interactions between actors and the system.

**2. Architectural Design:**
- Define the high-level structure of the system.
- Identify key components and their interactions.
- Use class diagrams, component diagrams, and deployment diagrams.

**3. Object Class Identification:**
- Identify the classes that represent the entities in the system.
- Determine their attributes, methods, and relationships.
- Use class diagrams for representation.

**4. Design Models:**
- **Static Models**: Represent the structure of the system (e.g., class diagrams).
- **Dynamic Models**: Represent the behavior of the system (e.g., sequence diagrams, state diagrams).

**5. Interface Specification:**
- Define the interfaces between different components or subsystems.
- Specify the methods, parameters, and return types.
- Use interface diagrams and class diagrams.

**Design Patterns:**
- Design patterns are reusable solutions to common design problems.
- **Examples**:
  - **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance.
  - **Factory Method**: Creates objects without specifying the exact class.
  - **Observer**: Allows objects to be notified of changes in other objects.
  - **Decorator**: Adds behavior to objects dynamically.

**Implementation Issues:**
- **Code Quality**: Maintain readable, well-documented, and modular code.
- **Testing**: Write unit tests, integration tests, and system tests.
- **Version Control**: Use tools like Git to manage code versions and collaboration.
- **Deployment**: Plan for deployment environments and automate the deployment process.
- **Security**: Implement security best practices to protect data and ensure privacy.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize code and resources for better performance.
