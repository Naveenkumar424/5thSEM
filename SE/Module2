### Requirements Engineering

Requirements engineering involves the processes and activities required to identify, document, validate, and manage the needs and requirements of stakeholders for a software system.

### Functional and Non-functional Requirements

**Functional Requirements:**
- Define specific behaviors or functions of a system.
- Describe what the system should do.
- Examples: user authentication, data processing, reporting.

**Non-functional Requirements:**
- Define system attributes such as performance, usability, reliability, etc.
- Describe how the system should behave.
- Examples: system response time, security, scalability.

### Software Requirements Document

A Software Requirements Document (SRD) is a comprehensive description of the intended purpose and environment for the software under development. It includes both functional and non-functional requirements.

**Key Sections:**
1. **Introduction**: Purpose, scope, definitions, acronyms, abbreviations.
2. **Overall Description**: Product perspective, product functions, user characteristics, constraints, assumptions.
3. **Specific Requirements**: Detailed functional requirements, non-functional requirements, use cases, data requirements.

### Requirements Specification

Requirements specification involves creating a detailed, precise, and verifiable document that describes the system requirements.

**Components:**
- **Functional Requirements**: Detailed list of all functions the system must perform.
- **Non-functional Requirements**: Detailed list of all system attributes and quality requirements.
- **Use Cases**: Scenarios describing how users will interact with the system.
- **Diagrams**: Visual representations such as data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams.

### Requirements Engineering Processes

**1. Requirements Elicitation and Analysis:**
   - Gathering and analyzing stakeholder requirements to understand their needs and constraints.
   - Techniques: interviews, surveys, document analysis, observation, prototyping.

**2. Requirements Specification:**
   - Documenting the requirements in a clear, detailed, and verifiable manner.

**3. Requirements Validation:**
   - Ensuring that the documented requirements accurately reflect the stakeholders' needs.
   - Techniques: reviews, inspections, walkthroughs, testing.

**4. Requirements Management:**
   - Managing changes to requirements throughout the project lifecycle.
   - Ensuring traceability, tracking changes, and maintaining a clear record of requirements.

### Requirements Elicitation and Analysis

**Elicitation Techniques:**
- Interviews
- Surveys and questionnaires
- Workshops
- Document analysis
- Observation
- Prototyping

**Analysis Techniques:**
- Requirements classification and organization
- Conflict resolution
- Prioritization
- Conceptual modeling

### Requirements Validation

**Validation Techniques:**
- Requirements reviews
- Prototyping
- Test case generation
- Consistency and completeness checks
- Stakeholder approval

### Requirements Management

**Activities:**
- **Change Management**: Handling changes in requirements systematically.
- **Version Control**: Keeping track of different versions of the requirements document.
- **Traceability**: Ensuring each requirement is linked to its source and any related artifacts.
- **Impact Analysis**: Assessing the impact of requirement changes on the project.

**Tools and Techniques:**
- Requirements management tools (e.g., IBM Rational DOORS, JIRA)
- Version control systems (e.g., Git)
- Traceability matrices

Effective requirements engineering ensures that the software system meets the needs of stakeholders and is developed within constraints such as time and budget. If you need more details or examples, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ“˜ðŸ’»
