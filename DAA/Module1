### Introduction: What is an Algorithm?

An **algorithm** is a finite sequence of well-defined instructions used to solve a problem or perform a task. It is a step-by-step procedure for calculations, data processing, and automated reasoning tasks. Algorithms are essential in computer science for designing efficient and effective software.

### Fundamentals of Algorithmic Problem Solving

1. **Understanding the Problem**: Clearly define the problem to be solved.
2. **Algorithm Design**: Create a step-by-step procedure to solve the problem.
3. **Correctness**: Ensure the algorithm produces the correct output for all possible inputs.
4. **Efficiency**: Optimize the algorithm to use minimal resources (time and space).
5. **Implementation**: Translate the algorithm into a programming language.
6. **Testing**: Verify the algorithm's correctness and efficiency with various test cases.

### Fundamentals of the Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency

Analyzing an algorithm's efficiency involves evaluating its resource consumption, primarily time (execution time) and space (memory usage). The goal is to choose the most efficient algorithm for a given problem.

### Analysis Framework

1. **Input Size**: The size of the input, typically denoted as 'n', affects the algorithm's performance.
2. **Basic Operations**: Identify the fundamental operations that contribute to the algorithm's running time.
3. **Cost Model**: Assign a cost to each basic operation and calculate the total cost.
4. **Running Time**: Analyze the total number of basic operations as a function of input size.

### Measuring the Input Size

The input size (n) is a crucial parameter that determines the algorithm's efficiency. It can be:
- **Number of elements** in an array or list.
- **Size of a matrix**.
- **Number of vertices and edges** in a graph.
- **Length of a string**.

### Units for Measuring Running Time

Running time is measured in terms of the number of basic operations performed by the algorithm. Common units include:
- **Constant time (O(1))**: Independent of input size.
- **Linear time (O(n))**: Proportional to input size.
- **Quadratic time (O(n^2))**: Proportional to the square of the input size.

### Orders of Growth

The order of growth describes how the running time of an algorithm increases with the input size. Common growth orders include:
- **O(1)**: Constant time
- **O(log n)**: Logarithmic time
- **O(n)**: Linear time
- **O(n log n)**: Linearithmic time
- **O(n^2)**: Quadratic time
- **O(2^n)**: Exponential time

### Worst-case, Best-case, and Average-case Efficiencies

1. **Worst-case Efficiency**:
   - Describes the maximum time an algorithm takes to complete.
   - Provides an upper bound on running time.
   - Important for ensuring performance in the most challenging scenarios.

2. **Best-case Efficiency**:
   - Describes the minimum time an algorithm takes to complete.
   - Provides a lower bound on running time.
   - Useful for understanding the optimal performance.

3. **Average-case Efficiency**:
   - Describes the expected running time over all possible inputs.
   - Requires probabilistic analysis to determine the average behavior.

Understanding and analyzing these factors help in selecting the most appropriate algorithm for a given problem, ensuring it is both effective and efficient.
